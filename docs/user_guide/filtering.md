# Filtering

CANpeek allows you to filter the CAN frames that are displayed in the Trace and Grouped Views. This is useful for focusing on specific messages or reducing the amount of data displayed.

## Creating a Filter

To create a filter, right-click on the **Filters** item in the Project Explorer and select **Add Filter**. This will open the Filter Editor.

## Filter Editor

The Filter Editor allows you to define the criteria for your filter. You can filter by:

-   **ID**: The CAN identifier of the frame.
-   **Data**: The data payload of the frame.

You can create multiple filter rules and combine them with logical AND and OR operations.

## Applying a Filter

To apply a filter, check the box next to the filter's name in the Project Explorer. You can apply multiple filters at the same time.
